# Hideaway Sportsbook - Learning Project

## Purpose

This is a **casual learning project** built for fun and education. The primary goals are:

1. **Learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails** - Understand the language fundamentals and Rails conventions
2. **Understand sports betting mechanics** - Learn how betting lines work, how odds are calculated, and how sportsbooks operate
3. **Quick implementation over perfection** - Focus on getting features working rather than production-ready code

## Project Scope

### What We're Building

A local development sportsbook application with:

- **Front-facing UI** - Simple, generic interface to browse upcoming games and betting lines
- **Backend database** - Store games, teams, and betting odds
- **Betting line creation** - Logic to create and manage betting lines for upcoming sporting events
- **Display functionality** - Show betting lines in an appealing, easy-to-read format

### What We're NOT Building

To keep this project focused on learning the core concepts, we are **intentionally excluding**:

- ❌ User authentication/authorization
- ❌ Extensive logging systems
- ❌ Multiple environments (production, staging, etc.)
- ❌ Payment processing
- ❌ Advanced UI/UX features
- ❌ Deployment configuration
- ❌ Complex error handling

## Development Approach

**Environment**: Local laptop development only

**Philosophy**:
- Start simple, iterate quickly
- Learn by doing
- Focus on understanding Ruby patterns and Rails conventions
- Don't worry about edge cases initially
- Generic UI elements are fine - no need for fancy styling

## Learning Priorities

1. Ruby syntax and idioms
2. Rails MVC architecture
3. ActiveRecord and database interactions
4. Sports betting line calculations
5. Basic Rails views and forms

## Note

This is a **learning tool**, not a production application. Code quality will improve over time as Ruby best practices are learned, but the initial focus is on functionality and understanding the fundamentals.
